The usage is quite straightforward.
Upon launching the application you have to select at least a beat description
by clicking on Rhythms.
You will be presented with a list of the current beat descriptions you have
previously entered, as well as a button to add more.
To load a rhythm, just double click it.
You may also load an SFZ file in the same way, or use the MIDI output.

Once the rhythm is loaded, you can use the buttons to launch the rhythm,
fills and parts.
You can also use a midi controller
by setting the proper input channel and input CC in the options.
After this, the behavior is:
- a tap starts the live rhythm, and if already started it makes a fill.
- a long tap transitions into the next part.
- 2 taps trigger the ending.
